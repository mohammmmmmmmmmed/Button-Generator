# Simple CSS Button Code Generator

Welcome to the Simple CSS Button Code Generator! This project is a user-friendly tool designed to generate CSS code for custom buttons based on your preferences. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this generator allows you to create buttons with various styles and instantly obtain the corresponding code to use in your projects.

## Motivation

I created this tool because I'm lazy. Manually writing CSS code for buttons every time I need one is tedious and repetitive. With this generator, you can quickly create buttons with your desired styles and get the code instantly, saving you time and effort.

## Features

- **Real-time customization:** Adjust button properties like color, size, border radius, shadow, and more.
- **Instant code generation:** Get the CSS code for your custom button instantly.
- **Easy to use:** Simple, intuitive interface for quick button customization.
- **Copy to clipboard:** Easily copy the generated CSS code to your clipboard.
